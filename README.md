The archiso project features scripts and configuration templates to build installation media (*.iso* images and
*.tar bootstrap images) as well as netboot artifacts for BIOS and UEFI based systems on the x86_64 architecture.
Currently creating the images is only supported on Arch Linux but may work on other operating systems as well.
